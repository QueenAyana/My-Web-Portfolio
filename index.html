                                <p>Well hello there! My name is Amber Ren√©e Brune, I am 27 years old and this is my first ever webpage. I know, super cool right? Anyway, I am a student at UCLA and I work at MOD pizza as a shift lead. I'm an avid PC gamer and ballet dancer.</p>
                                <p>I live in Rolling Hills, Ca and love to go camping in the Sierra Navada Mountains. I spend what little freetime I have playing Minecraft or Destiny2. One of my goals is to be a part of making better artificial intelligence.</p>
                                <p>I value truth and honor above most things and have a hard time dealing with change. I've been blessed with a very enlightened look on life. I love Heavy Metal and EDM. my favorite band is Five Finger Death Punch, but Volbeat is a close second. So you best believe im rocking out as i make these web pages.</p>
                                <p>May you live long and prosper, and may the force be with you!</p>
