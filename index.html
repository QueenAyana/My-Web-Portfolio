                        <p>Well hello there! My name is Amber Ren√©e Brune, I am 27 years old and this is my web-based portfolio.
                            I am currently a student at UCLA in their full stack web development bootcamp and I work at MOD
                            pizza as a shift lead. I'm an avid PC gamer and ballet dancer. </p>
                        <p>I have been learning a lot in class so far. I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                            and can now produce functional frontend webpages. I also enjoy creating beautiful UI/UX designed
                            pages using a combination of bootstrap and vanilla CSS. JavaScript has been a bit of a challenge
                            for me, but I understand the logic behind the code I have written thus far and am continuing
                            to learn more on its functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>I value truth and honor above most things and always pride myself on my work ethic. I've been blessed
                            with an understanding that all the work you do in life has your name on it. therefore, I always
                            work my hardest to make my work represent someone who values what they do.
                        </p>
